# Future Plans

Ok, this probably won't make sense to other humans for a while! Sorry about

## Basic Structure

(For the root list, these things all build on top of each other.)

* async binary objects
* binary streams
* binary stream filters
  * buffered stream
  * gzip stream
* text stream adapters
  * ascii stream
  * utf8 stream
* localized text stream filters (?)
  maybe just wrap this up into text stream adapters
* formatted i/o
